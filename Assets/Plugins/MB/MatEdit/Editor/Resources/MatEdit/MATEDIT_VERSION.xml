Some Instructions:
	
You can use MatEdit for all your custom shaders.

Please do not distribute the tool on the internet.
If you plan to distribute your shader including the ShaderGUI please follow the "Distribute with MatEdit" guidline in the Documentation.

To see how the tool works simply click on the documentation button below.

If you delete MatEdit from your project be sure to use the uninstall function in this window beforehand.
If you only see an Upgrade or Downgrade option you have to use this first!
