# MatEdit for Unity3D
## Introduction
MatEdit is a script which you can use to make good looking custom editors for shaders very fast and without any affort.

**MatEdit Version 1 is obsolete. There wonâ€™t be any updates or improvements in the future.**

## Basic Steps

1. Create a new custom editor script for a shader of your choice and put it into an editor folder somewhere in your project.
2. Add CustomEditor "<CustomEditorScript>" in front of the last brace of your shader.
3. Use the namespace Northwind.Editor.Shader to access MatEdit
4. In the OnGUI function access the target material and set it as scope material in MatEdit by using: MatEdit.SetScope(<TargetMaterial>);
5. Use one of the included MatEdit functions to set a value in your shader
